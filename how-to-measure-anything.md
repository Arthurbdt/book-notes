# Section 1: Measurement: The Solution Exists


## Chapter 1: Intangibles and the Challenge

This books aims to show:
1. Intangibles that appear completely intractable can be measured
2. The measurement can be done in a way that is economically justified

Propositions for problem of measurement in business:
- Measurements inform uncertain decisions
- For any decision, there are a large combinations of things to measure and ways to measure them, but perfect certainty is rarely a realistic option
- Management needs a method to analyze options to reduce uncertainty about decisions


## Chapter 2: An intuitive measurement habit: Erathostene, Enrico and Emily
- Erathostenes measured the circumference of the Earthusing the length of shadows in different cities with simple geometry
- Enrico Fermi taught how to estimate the number of piano tuners in Chicago (Fermi decomposition: estimate other variables, more easily quantifiable, e.g. total population, percentage of households with pianos etc)
- Emily Rosa: debunked paranormal claims with simple experiments


## Chapter 3: The Illusion of Intagibles: Why Immeasurables Aren't
People think something cannot be measured because of misconceptions about 3 aspects of measurement (.com):
- Concept of measurement - the definition of measurement is misunderstood
- Object of measurement: the thing being measured is not well defined
- Methods of measurement: procedures of empirical observations are not well known

> Measurement: A quantitatively expressed reduction of uncertainty based on one or more observations

A measurement does not have to eliminate all uncertainty.

> Clarification chain:
> 1. If it matters at all, it is observable
> 2. If it is observable, it can be detercted as an amount (or range of possible anounts)
> 3. If it can be observed as a range of possible amounts, it can be measured

Imagine a pair of the same organization (one for control, one for test). You improve your intangible on the test group; what do you expect will change? This can help defining the object of measurement.

Each measurement must support at least one decision.

> Rule of Five: There is a 93.75% chance that the median of a population is between the smallest and largest values in any random sample of five from that population.

Many barriers to measurement are not always valid.
> 1. Your problem is not as unique as you think
> 2. You have more data than you think
> 3. You need less data than you think
> 4. An adequate amount of new data is more accessible than you think

Economic objection to measurement: can be valid. Computing the value of additional information helps ensuring that additional measurements are worthwhile.

> Toward a Universal Approach to Measurement
> 1. Define a decision problem and the relevant uncertainties
> 2. Determine what you know now
> 3. Compute the value of additional information
> 4. Apply the relevant measurement instruments to high-value measurements
> 5. Make a decision and act on it



# Section 2: Before You Measure 


## Chapter 4: Clarifying the Measurement Problem
Some questions need to be answered before measuring:
1. What is the decision this measurement is supposed to support?
2. What is the definition of the thing being measured in terms of observable consequences?
3. How does this thing matter to the decision?
4. How much do you know now?
5. What is the value of additional information?

**Example: IT security at Department of Veterans Affairs**
- What decision are you trying to make? Investment decision; determine whether any of suggested investments were justified
- What do you mean by IT security? Reduction in frequency and severity of a list of undesirable events
- Fermi questions to compute cost of virus attack. Use 90% confidence intervals to assess ranges.

## Chapter 5: How Much Do You Know Now?
A good approach to measure uncertainty is to produce a confidence interval. Problem: people are biased (over or underconfident). People can be trained to remove their bias: this is called **calibration**.

Methods to achieve calibration for creating a CI:
- Repetition and feedback: take several calibration tests in succession, assess how well you did and attempt to improve at the next one.
- Equivalent bets: imagine spinning a wheel where you have 90% chance of winning. Do you prefer spinning the wheel or your CI? Calibrated individuals should be indifferent.
- Consider two reasons why you should be confident in your estimate and two reasons why you shouldn't.
- Avoid anchoring: think of the range as two binary questions: are you 95% certain the true value is above/below your extreme point?
- Reverse the anchoring effect: start with extremely wide range and reduce by eliminating unlikey values
