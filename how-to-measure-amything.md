## Section 1: Measurement: The Solution Exists

### Chapter 1: Intangibles and the Challenge

This books aims to show:
1. Intangibles that appear completely intractable can be measured
2. The measurement can be done in a way that is economically justified

Propositions for problem of measurement in business:
- Measurements inform uncertain decisions
- For any decision, there are a large combinations of things to measure and ways to measure them, but perfect certainty is rarely a realistic option
- Management needs a method to analyze options to reduce uncertainty about decisions

### Chapter 2: An intuitive measurement habit: Erathostene, Enrico and Emily
- Erathostenes measured the circumference of the Earthusing the length of shadows in different cities with simple geometry
- Enrico Fermi taught how to estimate the number of piano tuners in Chicago (Fermi decomposition: estimate other variables, more easily quantifiable, e.g. total population, percentage of households with pianos etc)
- Emily Rosa: debunked paranormal claims with simple experiments
